&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.icai.ai/">ICAI&lt;/a> labs are a concept initiated at the University of Amsterdam to encourage more collaborations between Dutch universities and companies and societal organizations in the area of artificial intelligence. It&amp;rsquo;s something I always tried to do in my own research group, because the only way to bring the results of our research to the clinic is by working with companies. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen many attempts by academics to do that themselves, providing their software to doctors, maintaining support for that software, and this tends to fail, unfortunately. Companies have been co-funding my research from the beginning, but the ICAI concept gave me an opportunity to take this to the next level. An ICAI lab has at least 5 PhD students and it&amp;rsquo;s a great vehicle to showcase your collaboration with companies in your field. When I learned about it, I started talking to the ICAI people and we decided to set up the first such lab in Nijmegen: Thira Lab. It was a collaboration between my group, &lt;a href="https://delft.care/">Delft Imaging&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://thirona.eu/">Thirona&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Biography #1</title><link>https://bramvanginneken.org/posts/bio/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bramvanginneken.org/posts/bio/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="youth">Youth&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I grew up in the south of the Netherlands, in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuenen">Nuenen&lt;/a>, a village best known for the fact that Vincent van Gogh was unhappy there for a few years of his life. The second most famous person from Nuenen, dixit Wikipedia, is a computer scientist! Edsger W. Dijkstra lived a few streets away from where I was born. My niece was his neighbor for a while. The &lt;a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/">E. W. Dijkstra Archive&lt;/a> is amazing. It has a lot of handwritten manuscripts, even from after 2000. Because, after all, a real computer scientist only needs a pencil and a piece of paper.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
