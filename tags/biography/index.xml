&lt;p>I grew up in the south of the Netherlands, in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuenen">Nuenen&lt;/a>, a village best known for the fact that Vincent van Gogh was unhappy there for a few years of his life. The second most famous person from Nuenen, dixit Wikipedia, is a computer scientist! Edsger W. Dijkstra lived a few streets away from where I was born. My niece was his neighbor for a while. The &lt;a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/">E. W. Dijkstra Archive&lt;/a> is amazing. It has a lot of handwritten manuscripts, even from after 2000. Because, after all, a real computer scientist only needs a pencil and a piece of paper.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
